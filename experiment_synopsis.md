# Experiment Synopsis: Neural ML Environment for Biological Realism

## Overview
This experiment aimed to refactor and tune the neural ML environment to achieve biological realism and effective learning. The focus was on improving interpretability, reducing bias, and enhancing the robustness of training and testing.

## Key Changes and Implementations
1. **Unified Configuration**: All hard-coded parameters were moved to `config.py` for centralized control.
2. **Learning Rate and Feedback**: Increased learning rates and strengthened error-driven feedback mechanisms.
3. **Membrane Potential Reset**: Implemented reset logic after each round for biological realism.
4. **Winner Selection**: Refactored logic to prioritize specialties closest to the target.
5. **Specialty Distribution Visualization**: Added histograms and logging for specialty mean/variance.
6. **Dynamic Cluster Management**: Periodic reassignment of neurons to clusters based on specialty and accuracy.
7. **Bias Reduction**: Randomized initial neuron specialties and increased neuron count.
8. **Activation Logic**: Refactored activation thresholds, leak rates, and refractory periods.
9. **Plotting Updates**: Saved images to `training_logs` folder after training.
10. **Logging Improvements**: Appended test results to `training_run.txt` and added debug logs.

## Results
- Improved accuracy and specialization.
- Reduced color bias and specialty collapse.
- Enhanced interpretability through visualizations and logging.
- Balanced cluster sizes and organic learning.

## Final Thoughts
This experiment successfully demonstrated the potential of biologically inspired neural ML environments. The implemented changes improved learning dynamics, reduced biases, and enhanced interpretability. Future experiments could focus on step-by-step visualization and human-readable logging for deeper insights.

## Next Steps
- Push the final state to GitHub.
- Explore additional interpretability improvements in future experiments.

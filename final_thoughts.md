# Final Thoughts and Synopsis

## Experiment 1: Neurons

### Summary
Experiment 1 focused on developing a biologically inspired neural machine learning environment. The primary goals were to enhance learning realism, improve interpretability, and address biases in training and output.

### Key Achievements
- **Unified Configuration**: All hard-coded parameters were moved to `config.py` for centralized control.
- **Improved Learning Dynamics**: Increased learning rates, membrane potential reset, and sharper winner selection logic.
- **Error-Driven Feedback**: Strengthened positive reinforcement for correct predictions and reduced penalties for incorrect ones.
- **Specialty Distribution Visualization**: Added histograms and logging of specialty mean/variance.
- **Dynamic Cluster Management**: Implemented periodic cluster reassignment based on specialty and accuracy.
- **Bias Reduction**: Randomized initial neuron specialties to reduce color bias.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Ensured robust training/test accuracy logging and human-readable outputs.

### Challenges
- Addressing learning/output bias required significant tuning of initial parameters.
- Balancing cluster sizes dynamically while maintaining accuracy was complex but rewarding.
- Debugging specialty collapse and feedback effects required detailed analysis of training logs.

### Future Directions
- Begin Experiment 2 with improved human-readable logging and step-by-step interpretability.
- Further tune feedback strengths, noise, and specialty learning.
- Explore additional biologically inspired mechanisms for learning and adaptation.

### Final Thoughts
Experiment 1 successfully laid the groundwork for a robust neural ML environment. The insights gained will inform future experiments and drive continued improvements in biological realism and learning efficiency.
